# NodeJS concepts.

All file in node is a module, a module is understood as an encapsulate object   

**Nodemon:** This is a tool that will allow us to tell you that as soon we detect a change, it reload the application.  
If you want, you can install it globally. This is the command `npm i  nodemon`. It's advisable to install many dependencies. On the other hand, if I install this in dev, I need to use this command: `npm i  -D`  
**_Important!_** Don't use nodemon in production.   
**Factory function:** Is just a function that create another function   
**Recommendation:** When you implement a pack, you'll be dependent. So, is recommend don't use a lot packages, just use the necessary because if the future you want to change something , you'll need to change many dependencies. **Use adapter patron**
