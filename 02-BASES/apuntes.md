# NodeJS concepts.
All file in node is a module, a module is understood as an encapsulate object 
**Nodemon:** This is a tool that will allow us to tell you that as soon we detect a change, it reload the application.  
If you want, you can install it globally. This is the command `npm i  nodemon`. It's advisable to install many dependencies. On the other hand, if I install this in dev, I need to use this command: `npm i  -D`   
***Important!*** Don't use nodemon in production.
